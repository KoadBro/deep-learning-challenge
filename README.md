# deep-learning-challenge

I preprocessed the data to the best of my abilities and used my knowledge of TensorFlow, to design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup-funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. I tried optimizing the model the best I could.
